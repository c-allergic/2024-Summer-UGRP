= Introduction: Encryption system and the factoring problem

Introduce Ising model that is used for optimization problem and conclude that it could lead to breakthroughs in analyze the vuneralbilities of RSA system since it's based on the hardness of factoring problem. Then conclude that reduce other problems into optimization problem is important since that we could then use ising machine to deal with that problem. So we develop a Julia package to help reduce problems of different types into your target problem

= From factoring to Ising machine
== Factoring problem and array multiplier
Factoring, a problem of decomposing an $n$-bit composite integer $m=p q$ into its prime factors $p$ and $q$. To specify it, we use the binary representation for the integer $m= sum_(i=0)^(n-1) 2^i m_i $, with $m_i âˆˆ {0, 1}$, $p=sum_(i=0)^(k-1)2^i p_i$ for the $k$-bit integer, and $q=sum_(i=0)^(n-k-1)2^i q_i$ for the $(n-k)$-bit integer. The factoring problem thus amounts to finding the unknown bits $p_i$ and $q_i$ such that $ sum_(i=0)^(n-1)2^i m_i = sum_(i=0)^(k-1) sum_(j=0)^(n-k-1)2^(i+j)p_i q_j. $ Note that k is a priori unknown since we just want to consider this specific problem. However, one could consider this problem for any $k=1,2,...,n/2$ @nguyen2023quantum.

Array multiplier is used for multiplication of unsigned numbers with full adders and half adders connected as building blocks @asha2016performance. To clarify it, we consider a simple multiplication of 3-bits binary numbers

$ 6 times 5 = 6 arrow 101 times 110 = 11110, $
the graphical representation of its vertical calculation and array multiplier is shown in Figure 1.

Using the array multiplier shown in Fig 2.(a), we could efficently reduce a factoring problem to a circuit satisfaction problem.

== Factoring $arrow$ Circuit Satisfaction

A boolean circuit is a directed graph with source nodes(inputs) and one or more sink nodes(output). The internal nodes, known as "gate", produce logical function of inputs. One could devide a circuit into a series of layers of gates and the gates from each layer receive inputs from the layer above them @moore2011nature. Back to the array multiplier and blackbox in Figure 2, it is obvious that each blackbox contains several constraints to its input and we could put this constraints into a corresponding layer in the circuit. Here, for a $n times n$ multiplier, we could define the constraint for each blackbox as:
$ s_(i,j) + 2c_(i,j) = p_i q_j + c_(i-1,j) + s_(i,j-1) $  <blackbox>

#jinguo([symbols should be annotated in the above figure.])

#jinguo([this equation should appear in the previous section])

for $i,j in {0,1,dots,n}$, let $c_(i j)$ and $s_(i j)$ represent the carry-out and sum-out, $p_i$ and $q_j$ denote the $i$th bit of the multiplicand and the $j$th bit of the multiplier, and $c_(i-1,j)$ and $s_(i,j-1)$ refer to carry-in and sum-in, where $i-1$ and $j-1$ simply indicates that each blackbox receives carry-out from the last blackbox in the same row, and sum-out from the  upper-left blackbox(which, in vertical calculation corresponds to the previous column) @nguyen2023quantum. In fact, the constraints are extracted from the truth table of AND gate and full adder and it elegantly simulates the logical operations in array multiplier through a system of these equations. Given these constraint equations, one could reduce factoring problem to circuit sat problem by putting the constraints of factoring problem into corresponding layers in the circuit. 
== Circuit Satisfaction $arrow$ QUBO

Firstly, we give a formal definition of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. Definition: The QUBO model is expressed by the optimization problem:
$ "QUBO: minimize/maximize" y=x^t Q x $ where x is a vector of binary decision variables and Q is a square matrix of constants.
For constrained optimization problems, quadratic penalties are introduced to simulate the constraints so that the constraints problems could be re-formulated into QUBO problems effectively @glover2022quantum. As an example, we consider the logical operations and their corresponding QUBO penalties in Table 1.

#jinguo("show gadgets: matrices J and h.")
#align(center)[
  #table(
    columns: 2,
    table.header(
      [*Logical Operation*],[*QUBO Penalty*]
    ),
    [$z = not x$],[$2x z-x-z+1$],
    [$z = x_1 or x_2$],[$x_1 x_2 + (x_1 + x_2)(1-2z)+ z$], 
    [$z = x_1 and x_2$],[$x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)z+3z$],
    [$z = x_1 xor x_2$],[$2x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)z-4(x_1+x_2)a+4a z+x_1+x_2+z+4a$]
  )
  Table 1:  QUBO Penalties for Logical Operations @noauthor_reformulating_nodate
  $ z = not x arrow y = (x space z) mat(-1,1;
  1,-1;delim: "[") mat(x;
  z;delim: "[") $
  QUBO expression of $z= not x$
]
In Table 1, all the variables are intended to be binary value and note that in that case, we have $ x_i^2 = x_i $ and thereby we could transform the linear part into quadratic one @glover2022quantum. For each truth assignment of the variables, the penalty would be 0 if the logical operation is satisfied and be larger than 0 otherwise. By checking whether the penalty is 0, we could determine whether the logical operation is satisfied. Given this penalties gadgets, we process by considering a simple conjunction of two gedgets. Given a circuit sat example

#align(center)[#canvas(length: 1cm,{

]
In (a), there is a simple conjuction of an AND gate and an OR gate. The output of them, $y_1$ and $y_2$, is then connected to the AND gate in the next layer as inputs. The conjuction of the two gates in the first layer is given by:
$ z = y_1y_2 -2(y_1+y_2)z+3z $ <conjunction>
So by simply change the literals in the QUBO penalty, we could simulate the conjuction of two gadgets and therby the circuit sat problem. The whole reduction of (a), from circuit sat to QUBO, is givenm by:
$ y_1 = x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)y_1+3y_1 $   $ y_2 = x_1 x_2 + (x_1 + x_2)(1-2y_2)+ y_2 $  #align(center)[and @conjunction]

 

== QUBO $arrow$ Spin glass and Ising machine

The problem of spin glasses is of great interest both in solid state physics and in statistical physics. Magnetic alloys such as Au and Cu where 1% of magnetic impurities are embeed are studied in spin glass problem. In spin glss, there is an energy interaction between spins of the two impurities
$ H_12 = J_12 sigma_1 sigma_2 $
where $sigma_1$ and $sigma_2$ are the spins of the two impurities and $J_12$ is the interaction @barahona1982computational. For a configuration $sigma ={sigma_1,sigma_2,...,sigma_n} $ where $sigma_i = {+1,-1}$, the energy of the configuration is given by Hamiltonian

$ H = sum_(i,j) J_(i j) sigma_i sigma_j + sum_(i) h_i sigma_i. $ <spinglass-energy>
The parameters $J$ and $h$ correspond to the energies associated with spins' interactions with other spins and the external field, respectively. Note that in @spinglass-energy we set the sign to be positive to keep consistent with QUBO's penalty rules. For a ferromagnet, $J$ is positive and a configuration with most interacting spins having parallel moments ($sigma_i = sigma_j$) has lower energy.



= Code Implementation

== Julia programming language
== ProblemReductions.jl

explain that we use circuit sat to spin-glass directly.

The main function of this pkg --- problem reductions. We have several problem types which we call it `model` in this pkg. And we have a good feature `reduction graph` which includes all the problems as vertices in it and guarantee that one could reduce a problem to any of others by checking the reachability between any two vertex in the graph.


= CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Conclude the work and try to find the shortcomings: not complete reduction graph would lead to bad reduction complexity(bad scalability); existing solver `BruteForce` is bad, we need a better solvers that may simulate the Ising machine in order to realize this idea.
