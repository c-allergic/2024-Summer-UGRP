= Introduction: Encryption system and the factoring problem

Introduce Ising model that is used for optimization problem and conclude that it could lead to breakthroughs in analyze the vuneralbilities of RSA system since it's based on the hardness of factoring problem. Then conclude that reduce other problems into optimization problem is important since that we could then use ising machine to deal with that problem. So we develop a Julia package to help reduce problems of different types into your target problem

== Factoring problem and array multiplier
Factoring, a problem of decomposing an $n$-bit composite integer $m=p q$ into its prime factors $p$ and $q$. To specify it, we use the binary representation for the integer $m= sum_(i=0)^(n-1) 2^i m_i $, with $m_i âˆˆ {0, 1}$, $p=sum_(i=0)^(k-1)2^i p_i$ for the $k$-bit integer, and $q=sum_(i=0)^(n-k-1)2^i q_i$ for the $(n-k)$-bit integer. The factoring problem thus amounts to finding the unknown bits $p_i$ and $q_i$ such that $ sum_(i=0)^(n-1)2^i m_i = sum_(i=0)^(k-1) sum_(j=0)^(n-k-1)2^(i+j)p_i q_j. $ Note that k is a priori unknown since we just want to consider this specific problem. However, one could consider this problem for any $k=1,2,...,n/2$ @nguyen2023quantum.

Array multiplier is used for multiplication of unsigned numbers with full adders and half adders connected as building blocks @asha2016performance. To clarify it, we consider a simple multiplication of 3-bits binary numbers

$ 5 times 7 = 35 arrow 111 times 101 = 100011, $
the graphical representation of its vertical calculation and array multiplier is shown in Figure 1.

Observing the array multiplier and blackbox in Figure 2, it is obvious that each blackbox contains several constraints to its input. Here, for such a $n times n$ multiplier, we could define the constraint for each blackbox as:
$ s_(i,j) + 2c_(i,j) = p_i q_j + c_(i-1,j) + s_(i+1,j-1) $  <blackbox>

$ c_(-1,j) = s_(i,-1) = 0 $ <functionality>

for $i,j in {0,1,dots,n}$, let $c_(i j)$ and $s_(i j)$ represent the carry-out and sum-out, $p_i$ and $q_j$ denote the $i$th bit of the multiplicand and the $j$th bit of the multiplier, and $c_(i-1,j)$ and $s_(i,j-1)$ refer to carry-in and sum-in, where $i-1$ and $j-1$ simply indicates that each blackbox receives carry-out from the last blackbox in the same row, and sum-out from the  upper-left blackbox(which, in vertical calculation corresponds to the previous column) @nguyen2023quantum.

== Factoring $arrow$ Circuit Satisfaction 

A boolean circuit is a directed graph with input nodes and one or more output node. The internal nodes, known as "gate", produce logical function of inputs. One could devide a circuit into a series of layers of gates and the gates from each layer receive inputs from the layer above them @moore2011nature. Based on this "layer" design, we could reduce factoring to circuit sat simply by pushing all the constraints in the blackbox to certain layers in the circuit. 

== Circuit Satisfaction $arrow$ QUBO

Firstly, we give a formal definition of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. Definition: The QUBO model is expressed by the optimization problem:
$ "QUBO: minimize/maximize" y=x^t Q x $ where x is a vector of binary decision variables and Q is a square matrix of constants.
For constrained optimization problems, quadratic penalties are introduced to simulate the constraints so that the constraints problems could be re-formulated into QUBO problems effectively @glover2022quantum. As an example, we consider the logical operations and their corresponding QUBO penalties in Table 1.

#align(center)[
  #table(
    columns: 2,
    table.header(
      [*Logical Operation*],[*QUBO Penalty*]
    ),
    [$z = not x$],[$2x z-x-z+1$],
    [$z = x_1 or x_2$],[$x_1 x_2 + (x_1 + x_2)(1-2z)+ z$], 
    [$z = x_1 and x_2$],[$x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)z+3z$],
    [$z = x_1 xor x_2$],[$2x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)z-4(x_1+x_2)a+4a z+x_1+x_2+z+4a$]
  )
  Table 1:  QUBO Penalties for Logical Operations @noauthor_reformulating_nodate
  $ z = not x arrow y = mat(x,z;delim:"[") mat(-1,1;
  1,-1;delim: "[") mat(x;
  z;delim: "[") $
  QUBO expression of $z= not x$
]
In Table 1, all the variables are intended to be binary value and note that in that case, we have $ x_i^2 = x_i $ and thereby we could transform the linear part into quadratic one @glover2022quantum. For each truth assignment of the variables, the penalty would be 0 if the logical operation is satisfied and be larger than 0 otherwise. By checking whether the penalty is 0, we could determine whether the logical operation is satisfied. Given this penalties gadgets, we process by considering a simple conjunction of two gedgets. Given a circuit sat example

In (a), there is a simple conjuction of an AND gate and an OR gate. The output of them, $y_1$ and $y_2$, is then connected to the AND gate in the next layer as inputs. The conjuction of the two gates in the first layer is given by:
$ z = y_1y_2 -2(y_1+y_2)z+3z $ <conjunction>
So by simply change the literals in the QUBO penalty, we could simulate the conjuction of two gadgets and therby the circuit sat problem. The whole reduction of (a), from circuit sat to QUBO, is given by:
$ y_1 = x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)y_1+3y_1 $   $ y_2 = x_1 x_2 + (x_1 + x_2)(1-2y_2)+ y_2 $  #align(center)[and @conjunction]

=== Reduction from QUBO to Spin glass

The problem of spin glasses is of great interest both in solid state physics and in statistical physics. Simply speaking, in a spin glass system, there are many spins that interact with each other and the onsite energy, such as magnetic field. In spin glss, there is an energy interaction between spins: 
$H_12 = J_12 sigma_1 sigma_2$,
where $sigma_1$ and $sigma_2$ are the spins and $J_12$ is the interaction @barahona1982computational. For a configuration $sigma ={sigma_1,sigma_2,...,sigma_n},  $ where $sigma_i = {+1,-1}$, the energy of the configuration is given by the Hamiltonian

$ H = sum_(i,j) J_(i j) sigma_i sigma_j + sum_(i) h_i sigma_i. $ <spinglass-energy>
The parameters $J$ and $h$ correspond to the energies associated with spins' interactions with other spins and the external field, respectively. Note that in @spinglass-energy we set the sign to be positive to keep consistent with QUBO's penalty rules. For a ferromagnet, $J$ is positive and a configuration with most interacting spins having parallel moments ($sigma_i = sigma_j$) has lower energy and vice versa. Here we notice that the Hamiltonian is composed of quadratic sum term and linear sum term, which is close to a QUBO form except that spin's value is not binary. A simple way to convert it is by setting $x_i = (1-2sigma_i)/2$ and substitute it into the QUBO penalty, after which we could obtain the Hamiltonian.

Consider a simple example of QUBO: 
$min y = mat(x_1,x_2;delim:"[") mat(-1,1;
  1,-1;delim: "[") mat(x_1;
  x_2;delim: "[")$, which is the QUBO penalty of $x_2 = not x_1$. We substitute $x_i = (1-2sigma_i)/2$ into the penalty and we have: $ y = mat((1-sigma_1)/2,(1-sigma_2)/2;delim:"[") mat(-1,1;
  1,-1;delim: "[") mat((1-sigma_1)/2;
  (1-sigma_2)/2;delim: "[") arrow y = -1/4 sigma_1^2 -1/4 sigma_2^2 + 1/2sigma_1sigma_2. $ Note that $sigma_i in {-1,1}$, so the square terms are actually constants. Therefore, we could simplify it and obtain the Hamiltonian of the target spin glass problem as: 
  $ H = 1/2 sigma_1 sigma_2. $ We could verify its correctness by comparing the solution of both problems. For QUBO, the solution is $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0$ and for the spin glass, the solution is $sigma_1 = -1, sigma_2 = 1$. Through the conversion, we could see that the two solutions are consistent.

=== Ising machine

Ising model is actually a simplified version of spin glass model. The spins in Ising model would assumes one of the two values, +1 or -1, to settle themselves in the lowest energy state with numerous alternatives in the process.The Ising machine is designed to mimic this process and find the optimal solutions for the model. Many algorithms are used to realize the Ising machine, such as simulated annealing, quantum annealing, and tensor network. Here are examples of the Ising machine:

In a nutshell, Ising machine is a powerful tool for Ising model. After the whole reduction process, Ising machine could help us obtain a solution of target problem and through extracting the solution, we could get the solution for factoring.

== Julia programming language

Julia is a modern, open-source, high performance programming language for technical computing. It was born in 2012 in MIT. Though Julia is new, it has a large number of packages and a strong and fresh community(JuliaHub Inc).

Julia is fast. Its feature of Just-In-Time compilation and its types system keep it from typical compilation and execution uncertainties @luo2020yao. At the same time, multiple dispatch feature allows the package based on Julia to be more flexible and extensible, which is not only important for the open-source community but also fit for requirements of the field of optimization problems.

See Appendix @Julia for more details of Julia.
== ProblemReductions.jl

In this section, we will introduce how to use `ProblemReductions.jl`(See Appendix @ProblemReductions.jl). The main function of the package is problem reduction. It defines a set of computational hard problem(`models`) and provides feasible interface(`reduction_graph` and `reduceto`)  to reduce one to another. Here is an example of reduce a factoring problem to a spin glass problem through the package.

Consider factoring problem: $6 = p times q$, note that in the package, the parameters for factoring problem is `m`, `n` and `input` where `m` and `n` is the number of bits for the factors and `input` is the number to be factored. Open a Julia REPL and run the following code:
```julia
julia> using ProblemReductions  #import the package

julia> factoring = Factoring(2, 2, 6) # 3 bits factors and 6 as input
Factoring(2, 2, 6)
```
When we initialize an instance, not only `Factoring`, we need to offer some information about the problem. For `Factoring`, we need to provide the number of bits for the factors and the number to be factored. And the outcome would be a `Factoring` instance with these information. 
 

```julia
julia> g = reduction_graph(); # get the reduction graph

julia> path = reduction_paths(Factoring, SpinGlass)
1-element Vector{Vector{Type}}:
 [Factoring, CircuitSAT, SpinGlass]

julia> reduction_result = implement_reduction_path(path[1], factoring);

julia> target = target_problem(reduction_result)
SpinGlass{HyperGraph, Vector{Int64}}(HyperGraph(90, [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]  â€¦  [84, 88], [82, 88], [88], [83, 89], [63, 89], [89], [88, 89], [88, 90], [89, 90], [90]]), [1, -2, -2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, -1, -2  â€¦  -2, -2, -3, -2, -2, -3, 1, -2, -2, 1])
```
The `reduction_graph` function returns a graph, where each vertex represent a `model` and each edge

```julia
julia> import GenericTensorNetworks  # solver

julia> gtn_problem = GenericTensorNetworks.SpinGlass(
                  target.graph.n,
                  target.graph.edges,
                  target.weights
                )

julia> result = GenericTensorNetworks.solve(
                  GenericTensorNetwork(gtn_problem),
                  SingleConfigMin()
                )[]
(-92.0, ConfigSampler{44, 1, 1}(10000000000000110101000001010010000011010000))â‚œ

julia> extract_solution(reduction_result, 1 .- 2 .* Int.(read_config(result)))
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 0
 1
```
The result is $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which is the correct factors of 6. The code above shows how to reduce a factoring problem to a spin glass problem and solve it using the `GenericTensorNetworks` package. The `GenericTensorNetworks` package is a solver for the Ising machine and it provides a set of solvers for the Ising machine. The `SingleConfigMin` is a solver that finds the minimum energy configuration of the Ising machine. The `extract_solution` function is used to extract the solution from the result of the solver. The solution is then used to find the factors of the input number.


= CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Conclude the work and try to find the shortcomings: not complete reduction graph would lead to bad reduction complexity(bad scalability); existing solver `BruteForce` is bad, we need a better solvers that may simulate the Ising machine in order to realize this idea.
